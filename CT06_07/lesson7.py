# ## Recap 1: Debugging Average Score Program

# ### There is a total of 3 bugs in the following program.
# ### Identify and fix the bugs:

# score_one = 80
# score_two = 90
# score_three = 75

# total = score_one + score_two + score_three

# average_score = total / 3

# student_name = "Alex"

# average_score = int(average_score)

# print("Average score for " + student_name + " is: " + str(average_score))

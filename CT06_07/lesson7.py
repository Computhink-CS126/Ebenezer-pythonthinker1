# ## Recap 1: Debugging Average Score Program

# ### There is a total of 3 bugs in the following program.
# ### Identify and fix the bugs:

# score_one = 80
# score_two = 90
# score_three = 75

# total = score_one + score_two + score_three

# average_score = total / 3

# student_name = "Alex"

# average_score = int(average_score)

# print("Average score for " + student_name + " is: " + str(average_score))


# for i in range(1, 11):
#     print(i)


# for i in range(2, 21, 2):
#     print(i)




# for i in range(10, 0, -1):
#     print(i)

# n = 0
# word = input("What word do you want to print?")
# n = int(input("How many times do you want to repeat this word?"))
# for i in range(n):
#     print(word)



# n = 0
# name = input("what is your name?")
# n = int(input("How many times do you want to repeat this sentance?"))
# for i in range(n):
#     print("nice to meet you, " + name)



sum = 0
for i in range(1, 6):
    sum = sum + input("What is num #" )    


total_sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5
print("The sum of the five numbers is " + str(total_sum))




# n = int(input("what number do you want the multiplication table of?"))
